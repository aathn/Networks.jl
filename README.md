## Networks.jl

This is a Julia package for neural networks. It is mainly for the sake of my personal learning, but I strive to make it as generally applicable and optimized as I can. Feel free to play around with it as you please.

### Features
	- A modular design allowing the creation of networks with different layer structures, regularization methods, cost functions etc.
	- Tools for visualizing and optimizing a network's performance
	- Example usage on the classic MNIST dataset

### Dependecies
