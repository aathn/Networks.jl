## Networks.jl

This is a Julia package for neural networks. It is mainly for the sake
of my personal learning, but I will strive to make it as generally
applicable and optimized as I can.

### Planned features
- A modular design allowing the creation of networks with different
  layer structures, regularization methods, cost functions etc.
- Tools for visualizing and optimizing a network's performance
- Example usage on well-known datasets

### Dependecies
*To be updated*
